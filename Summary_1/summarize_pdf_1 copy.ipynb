       "\n",
       "**Patient Background:**\n",
       "- **ID:** 1201466\n",
       "- **Birth Date:** November 1, 1946\n",
       "- **Gender:** Female\n",
       "- **History:** Recurrent lung cancer with metastasis to lung and adrenal gland. Previously underwent lobectomy (surgery to remove part of the lung).\n",
       "\n",
       "#### CT Findings (as of September 30, 2024):\n",
       "\n",
       "**1. Mediastinum (area between the lungs):**\n",
       "- **Left Lower Paratracheal Node:** Decreased in size (now 0.9 cm) compared to prior exams. This could indicate some response to treatment.\n",
       "- **Other Nodes:** Some small nodes present but unchanged in size.\n",
       "\n",
       "**2. Lungs:**\n",
       "- **Post Surgery:** Evidence of previous lobectomy.\n",
       "- **Nodules:** \n",
       "  - 2-mm and 4-mm ground glass nodules (areas of hazy lung tissue) were identified; stable in size.\n",
       "  - A few solid nodules noted, unchanged.\n",
       "\n",
       "**3. Pleura (lining around the lungs):**\n",
       "- Minimal thickening noted but no fluid accumulation or pneumothorax (collapsed lung).\n",
       "\n",
       "**4. Adrenal Glands:**\n",
       "- Left adrenal mass slightly decreased in size (from 5.7x6.1 cm to 5.4x5.6 cm). This may indicate a response to treatment. \n",
       "- The normal left adrenal gland is not visible, which may suggest involvement by the tumor. \n",
       "\n",
       "**5. Liver:**\n",
       "- A tiny lesion observed but too small to characterize, meaning itâ€™s uncertain if it's normal or abnormal.\n",
       "\n",
       "**6. Kidneys:**\n",
       "- Normal size; small cysts noted, which are generally benign (non-cancerous).\n",
       "\n",
       "**7. Bones:**\n",
       "- Compression fracture of the T12 vertebra remains unchanged.\n",
       "- No new concerning bone lesions seen.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Overall Impression\n",
       "- The lung and adrenal masses show signs of stability or slight decrease, suggesting a possible positive response to treatment.\n",
       "- Continued monitoring is important to evaluate the nature of the kidney and liver findings.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Next Steps\n",
       "- Regular follow-up imaging studies as needed.\n",
       "- Further evaluation of any new findings or changes in existing masses is essential.\n",
       "  \n",
       "If you have any more questions or want further clarification about specific aspects of the findings, feel free to ask!"
